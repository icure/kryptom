# Kryptom - kotlin crypto multiplatform

Provides access from kotlin multiplatform to:
- Native cryptographic primitives and digest algorithms including:
  - Secure random
  - Aes encryption
  - Rsa encryption and signing
  - Hmac signing
- Byte array encoding and decoding (hex, base64)

## Using the project

You need to create a local properties file in the root of the project with the following properties:

```properties
# Path to the android sdk, by default on mac /Users/you/Library/Android/sdk
sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk
# Name of ios simulator to use for testing, e.g. iPhone 13 Pro Max
ios.simulator=iPhone name
```

## Testing

Unit tests can run on all target platforms (jvm, js browser, js node, ios, android) using the various gradle `[platform]Test` tasks, or using the `allTests` task.

E2e tests are currently only available on the jvm platform, as the test setup library is not yet available for the other platforms.

### Browser tests

Currently the project is configured to do browser tests on Chrome and Firefox. You will need to have the browsers installed on your machine.

You may also need to specify the location of their executables through environment variables, such as:

```
FIREFOX_BIN=/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
```
